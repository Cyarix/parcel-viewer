description: "This map demonstrates the capability of Leaflet to render thousands of polygons using GeoJson Tiles on both desktop and mobile devices. Rendering, search and identify are handled by the browser, so there is no need for a GIS server to push data to the client. The original shapefile was converted to topojson using mapshaper, and the geojson-vt plugin provides some simplification. To identify the underlying polygons, the point in polygon plugin is used. Parcels with null parcel and owner fields have been removed."
notes: "Use zoom controls to navigate the map. Pinch & zoom and double tap to zoom have been disabled."
